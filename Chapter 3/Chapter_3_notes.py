# LISTS
# A list is a collection of items in a particular order. Anything can go into a list, and they don't necessarily need 
# to be related to each other. In Python, square brackets [] indicate a list, and individual elements are to be 
# separated by commas.

ingredients = ["garlic", "salt", "chicken", "tomatoes", "pepper", "lemon", "cream", "pasta"]
