# Greetings: Start with the list you used in Exercise 3.1, but instead of
# just printing each person's name, print a message to them. The text of
# each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized
# with the person's name

names = ["Tiffany", "Cassandra", "Nicole", "Sam", "Oliver", "Brandi"]

print(f"Hey, {names[0]}, thanks for being a great friend!")
print(f"Hey, {names[1]}, thanks for being a great friend!")
print(f"Hey, {names[2]}, thanks for being a great friend!")
print(f"Hey, {names[3]}, thanks for being a great friend!")
print(f"Hey, {names[4]}, thanks for being a great friend!")
print(f"Hey, {names[5]}, thanks for being a great friend!")
