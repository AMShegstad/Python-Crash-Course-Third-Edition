# Your Own List: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle
# or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a
# series of statements about these items, such as "I would like to own a motorcycle."

# I'm not really a car person, so I'll be referring to books.
