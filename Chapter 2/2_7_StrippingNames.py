# Alexander Shegstad

# Use a variable to represent a person's name, and include some whitespace characters at the
# beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n",
# at least once. 

# Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name
# using each of the three stripping functions, lstrip(), rstrip(), and strip().

name = "\t\nAlexander\t\n"

print(name)
print(name.lstrip())
print(name.rstrip())
print(name.strip())
